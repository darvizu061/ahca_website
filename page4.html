                <h1>Daytime Graffiti Team Committee</h1>
                <p>The Archer Heights Civic Association Daytime Graffiti Team was created in 2006 as an offshoot of the Archer Heights Civic Association Neighborhood Watch and ever since has been the eyes of the community reporting all incidents of graffiti. The Team has at various times had five to six members canvassing the neighborhood in two cars. Currently we have a dauntless team of three members that each Monday canvasses the community (every residential alley, commercial building and factory), records and reports any newly discovered graffiti and follows for the removal of tagging from previously reported locations.</p>

Our Hospitality committee currently consists of the smiling faces of: Lucy Lewner – Chair Person Kathy Esposito Rita Harazin, Ann Lihosit Ray Lytis</p>

                <h1>Government & Legislation Committee</h1>
                <p>The principle function of this committee is to review the Chicago City Council Journal of Proceedings & Legislative Index and report to the membership any and all ordinances submitted that pertain to or affect the Archer Heights community. All actions regarding changes of zoning, building codes, establishment of traffic signs and regulations, city budget, taxes, vacating of streets and/or alleys, establishing fines & penalties, sale or lease of city property, appointment of City commissioners, settlement of any lawsuits, creation of honorary street names and basically all actions that affect everyday citizen life must be submitted to the full Chicago City Council and voted upon. The Journal also reflects what ordinances are assigned to which committee for public hearing. The committee will also track the status of pertinent ordinances from introduction to committee assignment to schedule of full Council vote.</p>

                <p>Our Membership Chair receives and records all incoming dues for our civic association; tracks and assigns a unique number to each new individual, family, business or industry member; issues membership cards; prepares a cash transmittal form and conveys all dues payments to our Treasurer; inputs all membership information to our computer and generates the labels used for our monthly newsletter mailing. The Membership Chair also makes a report of new members at each of our monthly general membership meetings; publishes all new member names and address information in our monthly newsletter and reports to the Association President the receipt of any donations for our “Walkabout” Membership Recruitment Fund. The handling of incoming funds is a function of high trust. Therefore the Membership Chair is a key Board of Director Position who maintains and ensures the integrity of our membership records.</p>

                <h1>Sunshine Lady</h1>
                <p>Each and every one of our civic association members is important to the continuity of our neighborhood group and to express our civic association’s collective greetings or sympathy on life’s events, the position of “Sunshine Lady” was established over fifty years ago. Our “Sunshine Lady” is basically a committee of one person who handles the sending out of greeting cards to our association members who are celebrating milestone birthdays of 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 years and above. We also send out congratulatory greeting cards to couples celebrating milestone wedding anniversaries. For our members who may be temporarily laid up in a hospital, intermediate care facility, or at home, we send a “Get Well” greeting card in the hope of bringing a little “Sunshine” into their lives. On the event of the passing of a current dues paid member of our civic association, we also send a condolence card to the surviving spouse along with a $10.00 bereavement memorial donation. The memorial donation can be made to one of our local churches or a charity of choice.</p>

Each month details of our current upcoming meetings are conveyed to all southwest side newspapers, electronic media and the two Catholic Churches of St. Richard and St. Bruno in the Archer Heights community. The weekly southwest side newspapers publish our meeting notices one week prior to each meeting and the Catholic churches publish our meeting notices in their church bulletins the Sunday before each of our monthly meetings and also make announcement of our meeting at the end of each Sunday Mass.</p>
